# Ayush Saini | Engineering Student and  Wannabe Developer

Hey, I'm Ayush. I like building things that are fun, some live on the internet, occasionally break, then teach me something new when I fix them. Wandering between backend logic, data analysis, and front-end experiments.

###  What I'm exploring right now
- Strong Java and Python foundations  
- Data manipulation and visualisation with Pandas and Matplotlib  
- Web dev with HTML, CSS, Tailwind, and React  
- Playing with C and C++ for problem solving  
- Reliable databases using MySQL
